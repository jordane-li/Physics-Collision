# Physics-Collision
A virtual physical experiment system for the simulation of collision problem in physics, designed with Unity, script written in C#.

## Requirement
Unity version: 2019.3.0b4

## Fun Fact
This project is a curriculum design in my junior year. At that time, I just started to learn programming, and liked using Chinese in my code :)
This program seemed very difficult and fulfilling at the time, but now it seems to be only a piece of cake.
